I am interested in investigating the social psychological processes undergirding both historical and contemporary political and intergroup conflicts using lenses provided by moral and political psychology, and intergroup relations. One line of my research seeks to understand the psychological legacies of historical atrocities. In my recent work, I have investigated the psychological conditions in which people blame current groups for the wrongdoings of their group’s past. In another line of work, I am interested in understanding the psychological contributors to political and religious divisions. In one of the projects in this area, I am developing a new construct moral humility, which captures the awareness of the limitations of one’s moral self and being respectful of others’ moral strengths. In a similar vein, I am also working on understanding the psychological predictors of affective polarization and democratic backsliding. Finally, I’m also interested in and work on belief systems. This involves understanding the causes and consequences of the way people’s beliefs systems are structured and undergo change.
