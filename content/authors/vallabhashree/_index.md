I am interested in investigating the processes that underpin moralization i.e. the change of non-moral preference to a moral conviction. With my advisor Dr Mark Brandt, I am currently working on moral reframing as a persuasion technique within the framework of belief systems as networks.  Through my work I aim to deepen the understanding of how morality differs and changes across individuals, political groups, cultures, and time. Through my work, I also attempt to inform ways of reducing moral, political, and ideological conflicts and intolerance.
