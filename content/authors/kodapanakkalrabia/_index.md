Together with my supervisors, Mark Brandt, Christoph Kogler, and Ilja van Beest, I am investigating how people think morally about the uses of big data and underlying factors that drive this process. Specifically, I am interested in examining why people value some moral tradeoffs more than others, how self-interest and individuals’ ideologies play a role in these moral decisions, and how these moral tradeoffs affect real world outcomes and relationships between people and governments/corporations.
