We are located in the Department of Social Psychology at Tilburg University. In Fall 2020 we will be located in the Department of Psychology at Michigan State University. Our goal is to understand ideological and moral beliefs – such as political ideology, racism, religious fundamentalism, and moral conviction – and how they structure attitudes and behaviors, how they provide people with meaning, and why people adopt them in the first place.
