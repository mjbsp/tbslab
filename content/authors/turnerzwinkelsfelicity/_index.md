My research explores the extent that political belief systems can be conceptualized and measured as psychological networks. This research takes the new perspective that attitudes and beliefs might directly and dynamically influence each other rather than indicate an overarching, latent factor (e.g., liberal or conservatism). Through this research I aim to deepen our understanding of the structure of political beliefs and how and why they impact political behaviour.
