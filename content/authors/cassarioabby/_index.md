I am interested in how conceptualizing political belief systems as networks can help us understand when factors such as harm perception and emotion lead to attitude moralization and when they do not. I also have secondary interests in person perception and moral character, and how institutional and psychological factors combine to explain the emergence of political polarization in the U.S.
